## Updated Classes for CrewChiefV4 for R3E

After discovering that the **CrewChief team** will no longer update the Classes/Groups for **R3E**, I took the initiative to do it myself!

### Improvements Made

- **Missing Classes/Groups**: I added all previously missing Classes/Groups to CrewChief.
- **Performance Index**: Each Group now includes a comment with its current **Performance Index** (Source: [KW Studios Forum](https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/performance-index.10084/page-6#post-252538)).

### Important Changes - only affects the R3E-Only-Version (Option 1)

- **Official Naming**: I updated all Group/Class names to their official titles based on reliable sources like Wikipedia and Google. While I triple-checked for accuracy, there may still be errors, as I’m only human!
- **Class/Group Identification**: Due to the renaming, CrewChief will no longer display the opponent's class. Personally, I prioritize having the updated and correct Classes over this feature.
- **The R3E-Only-Version**: I have deleted references to other games in the JSON file. However, it’s possible that if this JSON lacks this data, CrewChief may reference the standard JSON in the Program Files folder. **Note:** This has not been tested!

### Notes on Newly Added Classes

- For all newly added Classes, I have included a comment indicating that **further data is required** (e.g., brake material and temperatures). Unfortunately, I couldn’t find this information since R3E lacks data in this area. I'm curious how the original CrewChief team sourced it!

### Installation Instructions

To install the updated classes, simply drop the file into the following directory:

```
Documents/CrewChiefV4/
```
**Important**: It must be placed in the Documents Folder; otherwise, the next **CC4 update** WILL overwrite it!

### Performance Index Reference

For the current Performance Index, refer to the following source: [KW Studios Forum](https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/performance-index.10084/page-7#post-252813).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Contributions are greatly appreciated. You can find me on Discord under the same name, as well as on the official **R3E Discord** and **CrewChiefV4 Discord**!

### Latest Update Announcement

Hey @ALL! I just updated the GitHub repository! You now have the option to choose between **two versions**:

1. **Integrated Version**: This version utilizes the standard classes of CC4 and adds the missing ones. It has the most support from CC4, allowing it to use voice lines effectively.
   
2. **R3E Version**: This is a reupload of the earlier version, featuring its own classes that may won’t utilize audio lines for Classes and are specifically set up for R3E.

#### Options Overview

- **Option 1**: **7zip with R3E Only Classes** - Be aware that this may encounter issues with voice outputs.
- **Option 2**: **7zip with "integrated" in the name** - This is the version I recommend! I’ve integrated changes into the original file, and it should not have any issues with voice outputs, except for the entirely new classes (which were missing) that I created.

**If in doubt, choose Option 2!**
