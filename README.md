# R3E_CrewChief_Classes
Corrected and up to date Classes for CrewChiefV4 for R3E

After learning that the CrewChief Guys won´t update the Classes/Groups for R3E anymore i made it myself.

Some Classes/Groups were even Missing in CrewChief, i put them all in and also commented the current PerformanceIndex of each Group (Source: https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/performance-index.10084/page-6#post-252538) 

1 thing i MUST mention is that i also changed all Group/Class names to their official Name (as far as i knew it or wiki/google said) - also i´m just a human it can have errors in it, but i tripple checked and seen none!
The change of the Class/Group names will have the result that CrewChief won´t mention the opponent's class anymore - personally i don´t care about that, but i want updated and correct Classes!

All newly added Classes (which were missing) have a comment that further Data is required, things like brake material and temps f.e. i don´t know them and didn´t know where to search, cause R3E has no Data, i wonder where the original CrewChief Guys found that stuff...

ALSO: This File is only for R3E i don´t know if the other Games will still work, cause i deleted the lines for them at least in the json here, but maybe if there is nothing in this json CrewChief will search the "normal" json in the Program Files folder. NOT TESTED THO!

Installation:
Documents/CrewChiefV4/     <--- just drop the file here!
IMPORTANT it must be the Documents Folder - otherwise the next CC4 update will overwrite it!!!

Current Performance Index: https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/performance-index.10084/page-6#post-252538

If you have any questions feel free to ask, any contribution is also muchly appreciated - you can find me on Discord under the same Name and also on the official R3E Discord and also the official CrewChiefV4 Discord!!!
